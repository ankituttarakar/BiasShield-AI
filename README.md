# 🛡️ BiasShield – Bias-Free Firewall  

FairWall is a smart bias-detection firewall designed to catch and prevent unintentional bias in hiring filters, recruitment platforms, or automated decision-making systems. It combines **rule-based detection** with **NLP/ML models** to ensure fairness in candidate screening.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- ✅ **Rule-Based Scanning** – Detects obvious biased filters (e.g., "Only males allowed", "Age < 30 only").  
- 🤖 **NLP + ML Analysis** – Flags hidden/unintentional biases in job descriptions or filters using AI models.  
- 🔄 **Hybrid Approach** – Combines strict keyword rules with intelligent AI-based context scanning.  
- 🌐 **REST API** – Exposes an `/api/predict` endpoint to check any hiring request/filter.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Human-in-the-Loop** – Suspicious cases are flagged for human review instead of auto-blocking.

# 🧠 How it Works

Rule-Based Check → Looks for predefined biased terms (gender, age, religion, etc.).

NLP/ML Check → Uses AI models to detect contextual or hidden biases.

Firewall Decision → Approves, flags, or sends for human review.
